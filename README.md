# Exercise
Define a 'Increment-Decrement' (call it whatever makes most sense to you) component that will display a number, an "Increment" & "Decrement" button next to it.
The start number should come from props.
The number should have a Number prop type and be required in the component
Increment should increase the number by 1.
Decrement should decrease the number by 1.
When the number reaches zero, clicking on Decrement should show an alert to the user stating "Cannot be less than zero" and not decrement into less than zero.
